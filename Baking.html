        <h2> According to <i><u>Wikipedia</u></i> </h2>
        <p> Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods can be baked. Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and pieces of bread to their center. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center". Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.</p>

        <h4> Baking Tips </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Read your recipe. <br>
                Before you even start adding things to your mixer, read your recipe all the way through.</li><br> <li> Follow directions exactly.<br> You can be creative while cooking, but follow baking recipes exactly. </li><br>
            <li> Substitute Sensibly.<br>
            When you make a salad, it is easy to substitute. You can use one vegetable in place of another. It is harder to replace ingredients when you bake. Every ingredient has a role in a baked good. If you do not have an ingredient, you may be able to use something that will play the same role. </li><br> <li> Add and Mix Carefully. <br> The way you add and mix ingredients matters. It makes a difference to the texture of your
baked good. Here are three common terms and their meanings. Beat means to stir quickly and completely. The reason you beat is to add air to the mixture. Blend means to stir together until just combined. The mixture may be lumpy. Mix means to stir until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The texture should be uniform after mixing. </li></ul><footer style="background-color:black; color:lightblue;"> <h3> The Deadliest Dish To Prepare</h3> <h2> FUGU </h2> <p> The fugu (河豚; 鰒; フグ) in Japanese, bogeo (복어; 鰒魚) or bok (복) in Korean, and hétún (河豚; 河魨) in Standard Modern Chinese is a pufferfish, normally of the genus Takifugu, Lagocephalus, or Sphoeroides, or a porcupinefish of the genus Diodon, or a dish prepared from these fish.<br><br>Fugu can be lethally poisonous to humans due to its tetrodotoxin, meaning it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat.<br><br>The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare the fish. Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.<br><br>Fugu is served as sashimi and nabemono. The liver was served as a traditional dish named fugu-kimo, being widely thought to be a tasty part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984. Fugu has become one of the most celebrated dishes in Japanese cuisine.<br>
